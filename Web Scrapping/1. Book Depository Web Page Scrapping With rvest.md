we’ll use the ‘SelectorGadget’ browser extension (can be downloaded from
the edge extension store) to identify the nodes containing each
text/link we want to extract we’ll extract the text from html_node
containing the book title.

``` r

From the output of the texts, we still need to do a bit of cleaning on
our texts. We’ll use str_remove-all from the “stringr” library to remove
the unwanted characters and whitespaces from our texts.

First, we’ll create a vector containing all the characters we want to
remove including the white spaces, then we’ll pass it into a for loop,
using the “str_remove_all” function from stringr to remove each of them
from our text.

``` r
Remove <- c("\n                ", "  ")
for (x in Remove){
  Book_Title <- str_remove_all(Book_Title, x)
  }

print(Book_Title)

From the output above, the link is not complete. We still need to
include “<https://www.bookdepository.com>” before the first slash. So
we’ll use the “str_c” function from stringr package to concatenate them
together.

``` r
Link <- str_c("https://www.bookdepository.com", Link, sep = "", collapse = NULL)

print(Link)

The steps above will suffice if our goal is to scrap only the first page
of the weblink, in which case we’ll just add each variable into a
dataframe.

What we’ll do is to create a for loop that will scrap each page (we’ll
scrap pages 1 to 5) using the same code from the steps above.

``` r
Books <- data.frame() # create an empty dataframe to receive our data.

for(pages in 1:5){
  Link <- paste0("https://www.bookdepository.com/bestsellers?page=", pages)

  Page_HTML <- read_html(Link)

  Book_Title <-  Page_HTML %>%
  html_nodes(".title a") %>%
  html_text()

  Remove <- c("\n                ", "  ")
  for (x in Remove)
  {Book_Title <- str_remove_all(Book_Title, x)}

  Author <- Page_HTML %>%
  html_nodes(".author a") %>%
  html_text()

  Published_Date <- Page_HTML %>%
  html_nodes(".published") %>%
  html_text()

  Book_Format <- Page_HTML %>%
  html_nodes(".format") %>%
  html_text()

  Price <- Page_HTML %>%
  html_nodes(".sale-price") %>%
  html_text()
  
  length(Price) <- length(Book_Title) # the length of variable "Price" seems to be lesser than the the rest, so we make it equal to one of the variables

  Link <- Page_HTML %>%
  html_nodes(".title a") %>%
  html_attr("href")

  Link <- str_c("https://www.bookdepository.com", Link, sep = "", collapse = NULL)
  
  

  Books <- rbind(Books, data.frame(Book_Title, Author, Published_Date, Book_Format, Price, Link, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)) # rbind prevents the new data from overriding the old ones. instead, they'll join the old ones as a row. The first argument (books, a dataframe we've created earlier), will take in the old data, the second argument(dataframe) will take in the new data and the rbind function adds it to the old ones a new set of rows.
  } 

```
``` r
View(Books)
```
Next, we’ll write the dataframe into a csv file so we can save it as csv
file.

``` r
setwd("C:\\Users\\HP\\Documents\\Datasets") # to set the working directory - where our csv file we'll be saved

Books <- as.data.frame(Books) # to convert book to a dataframe, this is needed so we can write it into a csv file

library("readr") # the library we'll using to write the csv
```
